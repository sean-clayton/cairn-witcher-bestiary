#huge-heading(level: 1)[The Warden's Tome]

Here I'll go over exactly what this book means by the popular term _"dark fantasy,"_ as
well as go over the included play area of Gresha, a continent full of danger,
wild magic, and personality. Additionally, here is where you'll find tables and
tools for generating sites, NPCs, locations, and more that fit a dark fantasy
setting.

#large-heading(level: 2)[A Dark Fantasy]

There are a lot of interpretations of what a _"dark fantasy"_ setting is. It
might mean an extremely grim, bleak, and borderline nihilistic feel to some, but
that's not what we're going for here.

Dark fantasy in this book means a world in which evil is prevalent and defeating
it is a difficult task. There are no true heroes, and those who seek to do good
do not often win the day, but it is a pyhrric victory where evil may have lost,
but at what cost? This is not to say that good must _always_ suffer great losses
to make their dent into evil, but it is all too-often the case.

Hope is also possible, but it is seen as foolish. There's lots to hope for---to
make it to the next town without being attacked by bandits, that the birth of a
child isn't lost, and for the next full moon to not unleash some curse brought
upon you or a loved one---but these are all possibilities that are not at all
uncommon.

Happiness is also possible---it is what most people seek, after all. Happiness
is not without cost in this dark fantasy setting, though. Happiness is to be
fought for and defended. Those who truly deserve a happily-ever-after to their
story are far few in number than your typical high fantasy setting.

All of this is to say that _good exists_, but it is outnumbered by those who
seek to do evil. Apathy is a plague that has spread across almost all people, as
the toll of pain easily wears down those who just want to live a simple life.
There is, though, always comfort in a good night's rest, a mug of ale with a
kind stranger next to the fire at an inn, or just the sound of calm winds at
sunset---because asking what tomorrow brings is likely a question best left
unanswered.

The player characters are not heroes that are destined to save a doomed world.
All adventurers, though, have taken the first step to being able to make a
difference---they have all decided that what they seek is _out there_, and have
decided to pursue it. If what they seek is to do good in a dark world, then that
is up to them.
