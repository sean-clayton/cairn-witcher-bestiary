#huge-title[= The Warden's Tome]

#text(weight: "bold")[#text-scale(120%)[Players read no further!]] This is the
Warden's section of #emph(title) and is meant for their eyes only! This section
contains the following:

- New procedures and supplemental rules to add mechanics that bring about dark
  settings.
- Dozens of new monsters to fill your worlds with.
- Gresha, a continent full of danger, wild magic, and personality.
- Tables and tools for generating sites, NPCs, locations, and more.

#item-title[=== Sundries]

When a character encounters a book or document, after careful studying, they can
use it to ask questions to the Warden regarding the subject matter within, and
the Warden _must_ give truthful answers with earnest---no catches! How long it
takes to study and the amount of questions is determined by the Warden when
creating the item.

This procedure is a bit on the "board-gamey" side, but it also gives the players
reason to keep books and study them with concrete utility they can actively
pursue. You may not want to use this procedure if you already have a preferred
way to utilize books in your game. This procedure gives you the ability to
create sundries as part of your prep---they don't have to be immediately used
for the session so you can bring them whenever players rummage through some
bookshelves. These are also simple enough to create on-the-fly with relative
ease.
