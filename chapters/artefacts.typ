- Toss a finger on the ground and it will worm its way to the nearest source of
  water.
- *Charges:* 1 charge per finger.
- *Dark Twist:* Blehs.
- *Recharge:* Stick the last of the batch of fingers in blood-soaked soil and let
  it grow---it will create another batch of several fingers within a week. When
  one finger of the batch has been planted and sprouts new fingers, the others
  instantly turn to rotten mush.// Nice try you munchkins!
