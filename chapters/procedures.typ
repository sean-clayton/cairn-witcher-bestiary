#huge-title[= Rules & Procedures <procedures>]

#large-title[== Character Creation <character-creation>]

#emph(title) doesn't alter too much about creating characters in Cairn 2e. The
most significant change is that players all begin with a Waterskin in addition
to the normal starting equipment.

#item-title[=== Waterskin <waterskin>]

- It has a maximum of 6 uses.
- It is _Petty_.

#large-title[== Recovery <recovery>]

#item-title[=== Recovering Lost HP <recovering-lost-hp>]

To recover full HP outside of combat, take a drink of water. If you don't have
access to a supply of water such as a well or creek, you must use personal water
containers such as a #ts-link(<waterskin>)[waterskin]. Personal water containers
have a limited amount of uses to drink from.

Once per day, you can drink three charges of water to remove a _fatigue_ from
your inventory.

If you do not have any water to drink from, you can only recover half HP
(rounded down).

#item-title[=== Recovering Attribute Damage <recovering-attribute-damage>]

#note[
  This is not the only way to recover attribute damage---the Warden can think of
  any number of ways to recover damage.
]

When sleeping in a safe location, you can choose an attribute to recover 1 point
of damage from. To recover damage to any other attribute in the same sleep you
must roll make a save with that attribute. If you succeed, it recovers 1 point
of damage.

#large-title[== Sundries]

When a character encounters a book or document, after careful studying, they can
use it to ask questions to the Warden regarding the subject matter within, and
the Warden _must_ give truthful answers with earnest---no catches! How long it
takes to study and the amount of questions is determined by the Warden when
creating the item.

This procedure is a bit on the "board-gamey" side, but it also gives the players
reason to keep books and study them with concrete utility they can actively
pursue.

You may not want to use this procedure if you already have a preferred way to
utilize books in your game. You also may not want to use this procedure for
simple notes. In the _Assassin's Bloody Note_ example below you might find that
it doesn't make sense to use this procedure for a simple note---it might just be
easier to create the entire note yourself.

This procedure gives you the ability to create sundries as part of your
prep---they don't have to be immediately used for the session so you can bring
them whenever players rummage through some bookshelves. These are also simple
enough to create on-the-fly with relative ease. This procedure also makes it
easy to have tomes with hundreds of pages of useful information without having
to create every page yourself---let the player utilize their learnings when they
see fit.
