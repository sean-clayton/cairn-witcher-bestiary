#huge-heading(level: 1)[Introduction] <heading.introduction>

The world of #emph(title) is a place where the sword you carry is worth more
than your own life, and the people around you will certainly try to test if you
prepare for that. It's a place where leaving the walls of your village is
considered an act of lunacy, for the threat of danger lurks freely in the
wilderness.

#emph(title) is a dark fantasy expansion for the Cairn adventure game. Inside
you will find new character creation options, magical spells, powerful
artefacts, deadly monsters, warden advice, a new setting and region to explore,
and more to make your game of Cairn come alive and evoke the feeling of a gray
and unfair world. Additionally, while the content within is certainly compatible
with Cairn 1e, it also aims to provide forwards-compatibility with Cairn 2e
which is currently in development.

    #item-title[=== Coins]

    There is only a single coin type in #title: _coins_. No more gold/silver/copper
    etc. It uses the shorthand of _c_ (eg. 10 coins is 10c). Anything worth less
    than 10 coppers round up to 1 coin, make everything else their silver value from
    Cairn---for example, a 10gp item in Cairn is worth 100c in Two Swords. This is
    effectively a silver-based economy.

#large-title[== What is Dark Fantasy?]

There are a lot of interpretations of what a _"dark fantasy"_ setting is. It
might mean an extremely grim, bleak, and borderline nihilistic feel to some, but
that's not what we're going for here.

Dark fantasy in this book means a world in which evil is prevalent and defeating
it is a difficult task. There are no true heroes, and those who seek to do good
do not often win the day, but it is a pyhrric victory where evil may have lost,
but at what cost? This is not to say that good must _always_ suffer great losses
to make their dent into evil, but it is all too-often the case.

Hope is also possible, but it is seen as foolish. There's lots to hope for---to
make it to the next town without being attacked by bandits, that the birth of a
child isn't lost, and for the next full moon to not unleash some curse brought
upon you or a loved one---but these are all possibilities that are not at all
uncommon.

Happiness is also possible---it is what most people seek, after all. Happiness
is not without cost in this dark fantasy setting, though. Happiness is to be
fought for and defended. Those who truly deserve a happily-ever-after to their
story are far few in number than your typical high fantasy setting.

All of this is to say that _good exists_, but it is outnumbered by those who
seek to do evil. Apathy is a plague that has spread across almost all people, as
the toll of pain easily wears down those who just want to live a simple life.
There is, though, always comfort in a good night's rest, a mug of ale with a
kind stranger next to the fire at an inn, or just the sound of calm winds at
sunset---because asking what tomorrow brings is likely a question best left
unanswered.

The player characters are not heroes that are destined to save a doomed world.
All adventurers, though, have taken the first step to being able to make a
difference---they have all decided that what they seek is _out there_, and have
decided to pursue it. If what they seek is to do good in a dark world, then that
is up to them.
