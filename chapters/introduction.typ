#huge-heading(level: 1)[Introduction] <heading.introduction>

The world of #emph(title) is a place where the sword you carry is worth more
than your own life, and the people around you will certainly try to test if you
prepare for that. It's a place where leaving the walls of your village is
considered an act of lunacy, for the threat of danger lurks freely in the
wilderness.

#emph(title) is a dark fantasy expansion for the Cairn adventure game. Inside
you will find new character creation options, magical spells, powerful
artefacts, deadly monsters, warden advice, a new setting and region to explore,
and more to make your game of Cairn come alive and evoke the feeling of a gray
and unfair world. Additionally, while the content within is certainly compatible
with Cairn 1e, it also aims to provide forwards-compatibility with Cairn 2e
which is currently in development.
