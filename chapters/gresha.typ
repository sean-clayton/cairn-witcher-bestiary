#huge-title[= The Continent of Gresha <continent-of-gresha>]

Gresha (IPA: [gri Éa]) is the included setting of #emph(title). It is a huge
continental land-mass that sits in what we would consider the southern
hemisphere on Earth. The year begins and ends in the hot months, with the cold
months in the middle. The dry and hot regions are in the North of Gresha, and
the cold and frigid regions are to the South.

  it will diminish the tone set out by this book.

While everyone's Gresha will be quite unique, there are still aspects that are
shared between them all.

*Gresha is dangerous.* The lands that reside within Gresha are filled with
monsters that lurk and prowl. People, too, fill these lands and they wage war,
lie, steal, take, and kill. Innocence is hunted and the weak are tested.

*Gresha is not 'gonzo' fantasy.* Mile-tall volcanoes that sit upon huge floating
islands don't exist in Gresha. No character on their own is a threat to the
world. Seeing owlbears shooting fireballs out of a tentacled ship probably means
you ate some neshrooms.

*Gresha is fantastical.* Ancient civilizations have left undiscovered ruins,
mythical creatures and hideous monsters roam the lands, wizards sit in their
towers experimenting, and artefacts of legend rest in dark corners. Every
settlement to rest in has a story and every character to meet has a past.

*Gresha is for the apathetic.* People here are not looking to be heroes. They do
not want to leave the comfort of the walls that keep the monsters out of their
small towns. They do not ask "what is over the horizon?" They certainly will not
risk their lives to save others---at least, not for free.

*Gresha is not hopeless.* Yes, evil is everywhere; Yes, war is hell; Yes, trying
to be a hero is suicide. There is also comfort in simplicity and the mundane.
People seek a reason to dance, to enjoy the day, to celebrate a life, and to
enjoy the comfort of those they love. While these glimpses of a normal life are
not an every day occurence, they happen and stand out amongst the grey.

#large-title[== Greshan Calendar]

- Days are 24 hours long.
- Weeks are 9 days long.
- Months are 5 weeks long.
- There are 8 months in a year.

There are some interesting properties of this calendar.

- Every month has the same number of days.
- There are 360 days a year---very close to the Gregorian calendar on Earth.
- Two months are dedicated to each season---one month for the beginning and one
  for the end.
- Every month has a "central" day to it---the fifth day of the third week.

#large-title[== Your Truths of Gresha]

There is no single correct iteration of Gresha. While the above characteristics
are assumed to be common among all Greshas, your Gresha will be different than
mine, is different to his, hers, etc. The Gresha presented here is actually in
the form of truths---your truths are what make your Gresha unique amongst all
others.

Patrolling the wood are *Ursheym Golems*---built by one of the
#ts-link(<giants-of-ursheym-wood>)[giants that live here] that wishes to protect
her home.

  #heading(level: 3)[Ursheym Golem] <foe.ursheym-golem>

  Ursheym Golems are much like regular golems. They are all made of wood, stone,
  moss, and vines. They are given the following commands:
  - Attack all of those who wish to do harm to the wood or its inhabitents.
  - Do not attack any inhabitents or friends of the Ursheym Wood.

  Each one also adorns a unique flower in its 'hair.'

#note[
  #note-title[These Giants are Real]

  Unlike any of the other characters, I consider these to belong in a specific
  location: The Ursheym Wood. These characters are an homage to 'real' forest
  giants where I grew up. They are placed in Bernheim Forest (the namesake of
  Ursheym Wood)---a place I have many fond memories of. It's because of this
  real-life connection that I consider them to 'belong' in the Ursheym.

  Read about the Giants of Bernheim Forest here:
  #ts-link("https://bernheim.org/land-of-the-giants/")
]

- *The Giants of Ursheym Wood* are a small family that live in the small forest.
- *Lamori* is giant that resides in the #ts-link(<ursheym-wood>)[Ursheym Wood].
  She lives there with her two children, Lana and Noso, and is pregnant with one
  more on the way. She likes to relax and lounge around. She does not tolerate
  those who wish to bring harm to the wood or her family, but she welcomes
  travellers who display peaceful intentions.
- *Lana* is a builder who constructs magnificent structures and other constructs
  all around the Ursheym Wood. She believes that one day she will build a great
  wonder that will bring all the people to visit the Ursheym Wood. She always
  enjoys when her little brother tells her about finding on of her constructs in
  the wood. She built all of the Ursheym Golems that patrol the wood.
- *Noso* wanders the wood looking for new plants, creatures, and 'discovering' his
  sister's constructs. He doesn't know she makes them and invents his own tale of
  each one and how they came to being. He enjoys looking at his reflection in the
  ponds scattered about the wood, and tries to reflectivity works. He also helps
  his mother prepare food.

While this family of giants do belong in Ursheym to me, still feel free to place
them wherever you wish. Maybe put an #ts-link(<foe.ursheym-golem>)[Ursheym Golem] in
a random encounter table for a wooded area, and if encountered, place this
family of giants nearby.
