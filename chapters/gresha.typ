#huge-heading(level: 1)[The Continent of Gresha]

There are many dark fantasy worlds out there that already exist which you can
use #emph(title) to play adventures in with little-to-no tweaking involved. You
may also already have a setting or world, though, and it may not exactly fit the
tone of #emph(title).

Gresha (IPA: [griʃa]) is a continent that should be easily placeable in many
traditional medieval fantasy settings. Its problems are easily contained to the
regions of the continent, at least initially---though, who knows where they will
spread when the players get their hands on it?

#item-heading(level: 2, outlined: false)[Some Assumptions]

While everyone's Gresha will be quite unique, there are still aspects that are
shared between them all.

#note[
  *Note:* I can't stop you from tweaking these, but just be wary that if you do,
  it will diminish the utility of this book.
]

*Gresha is dangerous.* The lands that reside within Gresha are filled with
monsters that lurk and prowl. People, too, fill these lands and they wage war,
lie, steal, take, and kill. Innocence is hunted and the weak are tested.

*Gresha is ripe for exploration.* There is a lot to see in Gresha. While the
gonzo fantastical things like floating islands don't exist here, ancient
civilizations have left undiscovered ruins, mythical creatures roam the lands,
wizards sit in their towers experimenting, and artefacts of legend rest in dark
corners. Every settlement to rest in has a story and every character to meet has
a past.

*Gresha is for the apathetic.* People here are not looking to be heroes. They do
not want to leave the comfort of the walls that keep the monsters out of their
small towns. They do not ask "what is over the horizon?" They certainly will not
risk their lives to save others---at least, not for free.

*Gresha is not hopeless.* Yes, evil is everywhere; Yes, war is hell; Yes, trying
to be a hero is suicide. There is also comfort in simplicity and the mundane.
People seek a reason to dance, to enjoy the day, to celebrate a life, and to
enjoy the comfort of those they love. While these glimpses of a normal life are
not an every day occurence, they happen and stand out amongst the grey.

#large-heading(level: 2)[Your Truths of Gresha]

There is no single correct iteration of Gresha. Your Gresha will be different
than mine, is different to his, hers, etc. The Gresha presented here is actually
in the form of questions---your answers to those questions are what make your
Gresha unique amongst all others.

  *Note:* War can be a very touchy subject---for many, war is an unfortunate
  reality of everyday life and use these games to escape such things. If the group
  wants to pick a specific choice in this list, then do not hesitate to pick it.
  Additionally, like all of these truths, feel free to come up with your own if
  none of these options satisfy your group.

#item-heading(level: 3)[Ursheym Wood] <ursheym-wood>

Patrolling the wood are *Ursheym Golems*---built by one of the
#ts-link(<giants-of-ursheym-wood>)[giants that live here] that wishes to protect
her home.

#cairn-stat-block(

  #heading(level: 3)[Ursheym Golem] <foe.ursheym-golem>

  Ursheym Golems are much like regular golems. They are all made of wood, stone,
  moss, and vines. They are given the following commands:
  - Attack all of those who wish to do harm to the wood or its inhabitents.
  - Do not attack any inhabitents or friends of the Ursheym Wood.

  Each one also adorns a unique flower in its 'hair.'

#large-heading(level: 2)[Characters to Place in Gresha]

#item-heading(level: 3)[The Giants of Ursheym Wood] <giants-of-ursheym-wood>

#note[
  *Note:* Unlike any of the other characters, I consider these to belong in a
  specific location: The Ursheym Wood. These characters are an homage to 'real'
  forest giants where I grew up. They are placed in Bernheim Forest (the namesake
  of Ursheym Wood)---a place I have many fond memories of.

  Read about the Giants of Bernheim Forest here:
  #ts-link("https://bernheim.org/land-of-the-giants/")
]

- *The Giants of Ursheym Wood* are a small family that live in the small forest.
- *Lamori* is giant that resides in the #ts-link(<ursheym-wood>)[Ursheym Wood].
  She lives there with her two children, Lana and Noso, and is pregnant with one
  more on the way. She likes to relax and lounge around. She does not tolerate
  those who wish to bring harm to the wood or her family, but she welcomes
  travellers who display peaceful intentions.
- *Lana* is a builder who constructs magnificent structures and other constructs
  all around the Ursheym Wood. She believes that one day she will build a great
  wonder that will bring all the people to visit the Ursheym Wood. She always
  enjoys when her little brother tells her about finding on of her constructs in
  the wood. She built all of the Ursheym Golems that patrol the wood.
- *Noso* wanders the wood looking for new plants, creatures, and 'discovering' his
  sister's constructs. He doesn't know she makes them and invents his own tale of
  each one and how they came to being. He enjoys looking at his reflection in the
  ponds scattered about the wood, and tries to reflectivity works. He also helps
  his mother prepare food.

While this family of giants do belong in Ursheym to me, still feel free to place
them wherever you wish. Maybe put an #ts-link(<foe.ursheym-golem>)[Ursheym Golem] in
a random encounter table for a wooded area, and if encountered, place this
family of giants nearby.
